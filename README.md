- 👋 I am an observational astrophysicist.  I got my PhD from Universite de Montpellier II in 2007. I did a postdoc at the University of Barcelona (UB): calibration of the photometric instrument of the Gaia space telescope (2008-2010). In Fall 2010, I joined the department of Physics and Astronomy at NDU university, Lebanon where I was the chairperson of the department.
- 👀 My research interests include the chemical composition of stars, synthetic spectra, binary stars, HgMn stars, model atmospheres, and numerical methods for astrophysics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML/DL techniques to be applied to stellar spectroscopy in order to characterize stars from large survey
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all ML/DL techniques that could be used in Astronomy
